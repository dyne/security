                        researchers and hackers alike to responsibly find, disclose, and help us resolve security
                        vulnerabilities.</p>

                Dyne provides rewards to vulnerability reporters at its discretion (see properly ‚ÄúSubmission‚Äù). Rewards
                may vary depending upon the severity and the impact of the vulnerability reported, alongside the quality
                of the report. Keep in mind that this is not a contest or competition.
